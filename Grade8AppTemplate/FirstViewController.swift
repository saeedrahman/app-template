/*
 
 FirstViewController.swift
 
 This file will contain the code for the first viewcontroller.
 Please ensure that your code is organised and is easy to read.
 This means that you will need to both structure your code correctly,
 in addition to using the correct syntax for Swift.
 
 Unless you are told otherwise, ensure that you are using the
 camelCase syntax. For example, outputLabel and firstName are good
 examples of using the camelCase syntax.
 
 All @IBOutlets should be listed at the top of the class file, then
 all variables, and then all functions (including @IBActions which are
 essentially functions)
 
 Please include details comments on your code to both demonstrate
 understanding, and which serve you as a reminder as to what your code
 actually does.
